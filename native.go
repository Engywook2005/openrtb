package openrtb

// 3.2.5 Object: Native
//
// This object represents a native type impression. Native ad units are intended to blend seamlessly into
// the surrounding content (e.g., a sponsored Twitter or Facebook post). As such, the response must be
// well-structured to afford the publisher fine-grained control over rendering.
// The Native Subcommittee has developed a companion specification to OpenRTB called the Native Ad
// Specification. It defines the request parameters and response markup structure of native ad units. This
// object provides the means of transporting request parameters as an opaque string so that the specific
// parameters can evolve separately under the auspices of the Native Ad Specification. Similarly, the ad
// markup served will be structured according to that specification.
//
// The presence of a Native as a subordinate of the Imp object indicates that this impression is offered as
// a native type impression. At the publisherâ€™s discretion, that same impression may also be offered as
// banner and/or video by also including as Imp subordinates the Banner and/or Video objects,
// respectively. However, any given bid for the impression must conform to one of the offered types.
